# TravelBookingSystem
An Object-oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) project in Java that demonstrates the basic functionalities of classes and objects by emulating a primitive form of how a Travel Booking System might function in the real world. Please note that there are likely logical errors in this as the purpose is NOT to build an actual Travel Booking system.
